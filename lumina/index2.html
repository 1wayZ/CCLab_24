                <p> Lumina Noctisã€‚</p>


                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>an exploratory team of deep-cave biologists. While navigating the uncharted depths, the team noticed a faint, rhythmic glow emanating from an aperture in the cave wall. Intrigued, they ventured closer and saw several of these luminous creatures, seemingly communicating with one another through their pulsating lights.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Lumina Noctis inhabits the deepest and darkest corners of caves, thriving in environments devoid of natural light. The bioluminescent glow serves as their primary means of communication and navigation in the pitch-black surroundings.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The Lumina Noctis has two distinct states: awake and asleep. When awake, the front end of its body emits a soft, blue glow used to communicate with others of its kind. This glow patterns in unique sequences, much like Morse code, allowing for intricate and detailed communication.
                    The creature is highly sensitive to external light sources. When exposed to light, especially from human-made sources like flashlights, it immediately reacts by swimming away to darker areas, trying to evade the brightness. If the light exposure exceeds 10 seconds while the creature is asleep, it will abruptly wake up and dart away to the safety of the darkness.</p>

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
